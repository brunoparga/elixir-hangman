# elixir-hangman

This is my code from Dave Thomas' [Elixir for Programmers course](https://codestool.coding-gnome.com/courses/elixir-for-programmers). Besides the Hangman server with the text-based and two Web-based clients (multi-page and single-page with Vue.js), there's also a bot that interacts directly with the server and plays the game.
